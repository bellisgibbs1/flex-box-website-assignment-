<div class="container">
        <p>Ramsel who is 39 years old and had pieces of his breakfast bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich in his teeth, responded right away when asked about the safety of riding bikes in New York City. </p>
        <p>He says, “drivers do not know how to drive, so it is not safe for anyone to be riding a bike.”</p>

  <p>There has been an uptick of people buying and riding bikes during the COVID-19 pandemic because many people were avoiding public transit because they feared getting coronavirus.</p>

<p>New York City Department of Transportation reported a 50% increase in bike traffic on the bridges connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn and Queens during the pandemic. </p>

<p>Citi Bike, a bike rental company in New York, announced that they had seen 67% more ridership since the pandemic began. </p>

<p>In June 2019, Mayor de Blasio released the “Green Wave: A Plan for Cycling in New York City,” a $58.4 million plan that confronted the rising number of cycling deaths in New York City according to the Office of the Mayor.</p>  

<p>Malie Jean who is 65 years old, says, “riding bikes is not safe, and there is nothing that can be done to make it safe.”</p>

<p>With the increase of cyclists in the city, many New Yorkers still think it is unsafe to ride a bike.</p>

<p>Motorcyclist, Jose DeJesus who is 50 years old and the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1179, blames cyclists for making riding a bike unsafe. He says that cyclists should follow the same laws as people who ride motorcycles, but they do not. </p>

<p>Cyclists not following New York City’s road rules cause it to be unsafe to ride a bike in NYC, says Jose.</p>

<p>According to the New York State Department of Transportation, motorcyclists and cyclists must follow and adhere to the same rules.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, many New Yorkers feel that riding bikes in New York City is safe, and that Mayor de Blasio’s plan is working. </p>
      
      <p>Shakhar Bidaisee, a 45-year-old thrift store owner and avid car driver, says, “that it is safe to ride a bike because the speed limit is 25mph, and when people go by the speed limit, it is safe.” </p>
      
      <p>The New York City Council legalized the use of e-bikes that’s maximum speed limit is 25mph in June of 2020. </p>
      
      <p>Trevor Wintz, a 39-year-old man, also suggest that it is safe to ride a bike in NYC because “there are bike lanes for people to ride in.”</p>
    
      <p>As, New Yorkers question the safety of riding bike in New York City, the New York State Department of Transportation reported that 24 cyclists died in 2020. </p>
